# Welcome to ByteRay Labs

Here we share practical, field-tested content such as SIEM queries from our comprehensive use-case catalog, which we have successfully validated across a wide range of customer environments.  

Our goal is to simplify the daily work of security teams and enhance the effectiveness of CrowdStrike NG-SIEM and Falcon LogScale in real-world scenarios. We focus on **Detection Engineering** and **Threat Hunting**.

## PowerShell Hunting Queries

As part of our work with CrowdStrike NextGen SIEM, we have published a set of specialized PowerShell hunting queries. These help identify and assess suspicious activity involving PowerShell effectively.

The released queries cover the following scenarios:

* **PowerShell Downloads**: Detecting file downloads initiated via PowerShell scripts.  
* **PowerShell Obfuscation**: Identifying obfuscated PowerShell commands intended to bypass detection mechanisms.  
* **Rare PowerShell Parents**: Analyzing uncommon parent processes that launch PowerShell.  
* **Suspicious PowerShell Command Length**: Detecting unusually long command lines that may indicate malicious behavior.

All queries are based on realistic use cases and have been successfully tested in different customer environments. They provide a fast and effective entry point for threat hunting focused on PowerShell misuse.
